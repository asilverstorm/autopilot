Hey, there. I am open-sourcing this bot to help others making their own. I ask that you don't directly copy my bot but try and learn from it. If you do, however, give credit where due. 

NOTE: My bot does not have a command handler, everything is organized in the index.js file. Yes, some things may be weird but don't pay mind to it, I made this when just learning to code using JavaScript and tried doing everything with as little outside help as possible. It does not accurately reflect my programming ability as of current.

DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED AND NOT UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF DISCORD.JS
